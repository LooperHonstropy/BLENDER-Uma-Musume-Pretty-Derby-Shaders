# Umamusume Shaders for Blender (WIP)
A Blender shader for Umamusume: Pretty Derby. Still under development, but I thought it might be better to get it out there now and improve it later.

## How to apply
1. Open a blend file with a model you have extracted, and then **append** the "Icosphere of materials" Collection. It should contain an Icosphere containing the materials and the "sun" object (**DO NOT DELETE**)

2. Apply the material to the model. There are 4 main texture groups using the same shader:
	**A. Body
	B. Hair
	C. Face
	D. Tail**
	Meaning **you would have to make 4 copies for each parts**.

3. In the shader editor, **apply the appropriate textures to the appropriate slots** (i.e. Base texture goes to base, etc)

4. For the face material specifically, **you need to assign drivers to some values in the shader node**. You need to hook the rotation values of the Head bone to the appropriate slots on the shader. So three drivers hooked to the X, Y, And Z values of the head bone. ***(THIS METHOD IS LAGGY, AND WILL BE REPLACED IN THE FUTURE)***

5. For the **outlines**, I have provided a simple outline material and geometry node setup for now. Simply **duplicate the mesh, and give it a geometry node modifier, and set it to the one provided**.

# Special Thanks
@AerthasVeras for sharing the dot product node setup
@elagrimm and @mojuko for helping with the face shading setup (even though it will be short lived)

# To-Do List
- Rework Face shading with better method
- Better Documentation
- Promotional Materials
