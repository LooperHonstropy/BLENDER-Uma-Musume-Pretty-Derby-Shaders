**Describe the problem**
Be as descriptive as possible.

**Screenshots**
Screenshots helps immensely in giving context

**Blender Version**
Please add what version of blender you're having the problem in. Lot's of things change after Blender 4.0, and I made this shader in 3.6 (though, it should theoretically be compatible with newer versions)

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
